### ***Description***

#### The backend of the interactive story app built using the PERN stack and three backend models would consist of a Node.js server running Express.js to handle HTTP requests and communicate with a postgres database using Mongoose.

### The three backend models would include a user model for authentication and user data storage, a story model for storing the the title and image, and a snippet model for adding the actual story contents. These models would define the schema for their respective data and be used to perform database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.

### Routes would be defined in Express.js to handle incoming HTTP requests, and controllers would be used to define the logic for processing the requests and interacting with the database using the Mongoose models.
